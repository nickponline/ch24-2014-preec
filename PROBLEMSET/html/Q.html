<h2>Q. Soundtrack vs. popcorn</h2>
<table border=0 width=100% cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td align="justify">
A well-composed soundtrack of a movie is in a very close relationship with the
message of the movie. In fact, they are so close, that careful examination of
the soundtrack may reveal important charasteristics about the movie.

<p>
Lately new trends appeared in music used for movies. Followers of the
minimalistic genres use clean sine waves instead of inherently complex musical
instruments. British researchers also found that using frequencies divisible by
100 between 500 Hz and 10000 Hz yield the best result in popcorn sales.
Other researchers confirm that the number of tones in the soundtrack at any
given moment is proportional to how fascinating the scene is.

You want to estimate the maximum popcorn flow for a movie - which is
(as the above research indicates) proportional to the maximum number of tones
audible simultaneously.

<h3>Input</h3>
The soundtrack is given as an 8 bit, mono wav sampled at 44100 Hz, containing a
(rough) mix of different, n*100 Hz sine waves (5 &lt;= n &lt;= 100). Tones are
always at least 1.2 seconds long.

<h3>Output</h3>
Two integers N and T separated by a space; N is the number of tones and
T is the time in seconds (from the beginning of the sound track) when
the movie is the most fascinating. If there are more, equally fascinating
moments and/or these moments are more than 1 second long, any such moment is
accepted as valid output.

(but for example 2 4, 2 6, 2 10, 2 11, etc. are also accepted).
