<h2>P. Film logistics</h2>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td align="justify">

You reckon most movies are leaked to torrent sites early on is because someone
copies the film when it's being sent to a cinema. To minimize this risk, you
buy only one copy for your cinema network, and after playing it in one cinema
you send it to the next cinema right away. You always use the shortest path
between two cinemas. There's a rotation plan, so every cinema has exactly one
movie to play (movies are all the same length anyway). This way at least you
know who is to blame when the first torrent appears.

<p>
The question is: how much does a movie travel until it gets back to the first
cinema? (This is proportional to the risk that it ends up on torrent sites.)

<h3>Input</h3>

A closed path on the surface of the Earth is given with a sequence of
latitude and longitude coordinates.
The first line is an integer N, the number of cinemas.
The following N lines are lat;lon coordinates of each cinema in the order they are visited.
(After the last cinema the movie returns to the first one).
Earth is a perfect spherical planet with radius 6371 km.

<h3>Output</h3>

The total travelled distance of a movie in km to at least meter precision.
