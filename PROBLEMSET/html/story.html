<h2>Prologue</h2>

<p>
You have recently discovered the real purpose of life, which is to run a
network of cinemas. You immediately gave up your previous plans (of running a
telecommunications carrier), and bought a couple of cinemas. The business is
booming, and you've already found three areas where you can use your background
in programming to build a competitive advantage.
